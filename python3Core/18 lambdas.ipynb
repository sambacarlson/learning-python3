    "PURE FUNCTIONS\n",
    "functional programming seeks to use pure functions\n",
    "pure functions have no side effects, and return a value that depends only on their arguments.\n",
    "This is how fucntions in maths work. for example, cos(x) will for thesame value of x, always return the same result. following \n",

    "-easier to run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "the main disadvantage of using only pure functions is that they majorly complicate the otherwise simple task of I/O, since this\n",
    "appears to inherently require side effects. They can also be more difficult to write in some situations.\n",
